What is WrappedRIA (WRIA)?

of 1 Million WRIA, these tokens can be used on the Binance Smart Chain for value transfers or
could be traded on DEXes like PancakeSwap. WRIA is pegged to RIA in 1:100 ratio, meaning
1 RIA will be equal to 100 WRIA while prices of both assets will be independent of each other.
